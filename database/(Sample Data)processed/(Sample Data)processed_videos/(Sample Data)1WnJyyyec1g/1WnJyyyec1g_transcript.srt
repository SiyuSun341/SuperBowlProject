1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
So why can't we say we're the best home shopping site?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,480
Because while true, you just can't say that legally.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,200
So I can't say, homes.com is the best?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,520
No.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,720
What if we jumbled up the words?

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,480
Homes best is com.ta.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,040
No.

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
What if we said it in Spanish?

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,560
Homes.com es el mejor.

10
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,280
No.

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,399
What if we whispered it?

12
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,080
Homes.com is the best.

13
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,800
No.

14
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
Fine! What if he said it?

15
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,719
Homes.com. It's the best.

16
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,039
Mr. Freeman, I'm sorry, but we can't say that.

17
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,679
Say what?

18
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,800
Homes.com is the best.

19
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,960
Homes.com.

20
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,760
It's the best.

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
you
