1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,679
We've made contact with a new alien species and apparently they're foodies. Oh

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,800
Foodies the worst. Mr. Ramsey will need you to cook for them

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,260
You'll have access to everything the area 51 test kitchen has to offer including top-secret alien cooking technology. Wait

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,800
That's just a hex clamp pan. I've got these at home

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,760
Unfortunately, it was leaked eight years ago. The pan was developed using material from an alien spacecraft

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
What?

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,260
Extremely durable, but low friction.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,260
Created to deal with a thick egg-like atmosphere.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260
You're saying the pen I use to farm my bacon

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,260
is made out of flying saucers?

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,260
We don't have time for a science lesson, Mr. Ramsay.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,260
The alien ambassador's already here.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,260
Whoa.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,760
Not her. Him.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,260
Hey, what's up, dude?

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,260
You're an alien?

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,260
All famous people are aliens.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,260
I'm not.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
I meant, like, really famous people.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,260
Seriously?

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,260
Oh, yeah.

22
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,100
Yeah.

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,939
Yeah.

24
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:56,759
Yeah.

25
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,599
Huh?
