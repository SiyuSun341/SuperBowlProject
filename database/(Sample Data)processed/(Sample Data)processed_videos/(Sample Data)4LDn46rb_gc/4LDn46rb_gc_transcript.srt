00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,299
Right this second at some diner somewhere, I'll have uh, someone really wants a soda

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,800
And they're not alone because somewhere else there's a bunch of other someones that are also thinking about soda

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,560
like her

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,359
Hello, are you okay? I'm thinking see

5
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,440
The soda feels like a lot of sugar right now

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,280
And these other drinks too much buzz

7
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,080
No flavor. What if there were a better soda?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hurry up!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey, yo!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hunt!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Bestie!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, I'm gonna freak out.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,759
It's a drive-through, not a confession booth.

14
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,200
Show up a poppy, please.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Stop spiraling.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Get a poppy.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Get a poppy.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Get a poppy.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Don't mind if I do.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Pizza?

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Hello, poppy.

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Hey.

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Oh, yes.

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
What a line-up.

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Okay.

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,200
I mean, a soda with five grams of sugar?

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,200
It's good, right?

28
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
You
