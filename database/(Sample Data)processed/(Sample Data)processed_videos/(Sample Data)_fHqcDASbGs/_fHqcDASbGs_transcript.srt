00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Nate, we need to talk about your finances.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,760
My finances are fine.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,560
With DashPass, I saved six dollars on my grocery order,

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,759
so I cloned myself.

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,120
Albuquerque.

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,200
Zero dollar delivery fees on dog toys.

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,679
I got me an opera singer that sings me complements.

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,559
She's so nice.

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,440
DashPass savings equals.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,559
Oh yeah, ballers.

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,400
You need to stop spending.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
You're not listening.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm saving.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,920
I quit!
