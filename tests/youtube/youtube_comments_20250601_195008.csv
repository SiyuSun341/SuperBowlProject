At the time of writing, the video has 1656 comments. This is only the 80th comment that is not made by an obvious bot, all saying short things like ""This was exactly what I needed, thanks!"". All end in an exclamation point. Therefore, 95.17% of the comments are bloat bots, commonly used to boost a video in the algorithm. In case they are deleted, let this stand as witness of this disgusting practice.",1,2025-02-11T11:38:37Z

HwqLPn3P4LE,@newscomauhq,"The best commercials of Super Bowl 2025

The Super Bowl 2025 commercials brought star power, humor, and unforgettable moments to the big game.

#breakingnews #superbowl #superbowlcommercials #celebrity #entertainment #sport #nfl 

Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunited in a Hellmann's ad, bringing back their classic When Harry Met Sally chemistry, while The Muppets brought their signature charm to a fun-filled Booking.com campaign. Pringles delivered laughs with Adam Brody, Nick Offerman, James Harden, and Chiefs coach Andy Reid, all rocking mustaches in a playful nod to the brand’s iconic shape.

Bud Light kept the party going with Post Malone and Shane Gillis, while Uber Eats turned to Matthew McConaughey to remind viewers why convenience is key. Over in the kitchen, Gordon Ramsay and Pete Davidson brought their comedic chemistry to a HexClad cookware spot, while Häagen-Dazs leaned into action-star appeal with Vin Diesel. Little Caesars delivered big laughs thanks to Eugene Levy, whose expressive eyebrows became the unlikely stars of the ad.

Meanwhile, Mountain Dew delivered one of the most memorable moments with Seal—yes, the singer—transformed into an actual seal via CGI, performing a parody of his hit Kiss From a Rose.

With a mix of nostalgia, comedy, and celebrity cameos, this year’s Super Bowl ads once again proved why they’re as much a highlight as the game itself.

HwqLPn3P4LE,@newscomauhq,"The best commercials of Super Bowl 2025

The Super Bowl 2025 commercials brought star power, humor, and unforgettable moments to the big game.

#breakingnews #superbowl #superbowlcommercials #celebrity #entertainment #sport #nfl 

Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunited in a Hellmann's ad, bringing back their classic When Harry Met Sally chemistry, while The Muppets brought their signature charm to a fun-filled Booking.com campaign. Pringles delivered laughs with Adam Brody, Nick Offerman, James Harden, and Chiefs coach Andy Reid, all rocking mustaches in a playful nod to the brand’s iconic shape.

Bud Light kept the party going with Post Malone and Shane Gillis, while Uber Eats turned to Matthew McConaughey to remind viewers why convenience is key. Over in the kitchen, Gordon Ramsay and Pete Davidson brought their comedic chemistry to a HexClad cookware spot, while Häagen-Dazs leaned into action-star appeal with Vin Diesel. Little Caesars delivered big laughs thanks to Eugene Levy, whose expressive eyebrows became the unlikely stars of the ad.

Meanwhile, Mountain Dew delivered one of the most memorable moments with Seal—yes, the singer—transformed into an actual seal via CGI, performing a parody of his hit Kiss From a Rose.

With a mix of nostalgia, comedy, and celebrity cameos, this year’s Super Bowl ads once again proved why they’re as much a highlight as the game itself.

But then, 11 minutes and 27 seconds later found out that almost all the ads are very mediocre. And some straight up cringe. I guess that now Super Bowl ads are just ads.  Nothing to be excited about. Budgets are big though and production is good, though, for the most of the part, but other than that, nothing to be excited about. Did I just repeat nothing to be excited about twice in a row?

09n73rbMyiw,@BrianaWalker-g4w,"Unfortunately, most of the commercials this year seem to just not be very good overall. Most focus on advertising a product by using celebrities instead of emphasizing what makes the thing good. The amount of celebrities in commercials at this point feels more like a brand advertising who they have connections with and less about selling a good product. However, I was asked by my English professor to evaluate commercials, select my favorite, and write a post about it, so even though I don’t think I could call any of them really good, there was one that stood out to me. The Hulu on Disney commercial did a pretty decent job showing off some popular shows that most people would recognize. It mixed in a lot of familiar content with a few newer shows, kind of covering all the bases for different kinds of viewers. Nothing too mind-blowing, but it got the point across, and as a non-Hulu/Disney user, it does a decent job advertising a reason to use their platforms.",2,2025-02-10T02:10:40Z

I want her to tell that story about AIR FORCE ONE and how her father was buried at Arlington Cemetery? I also want to know why Josh Williamson showed me this Popular Science cover that looked like his face on it? I even asked if BEMA technologies has some projects that made it onto that magazine? 

I caught one time the fiancé/wife/ or roommate of Chris Green used a gas to wake him up. It looks similar to a VAPE for smoking. It is a translucent gas that is used in SPORTS MEDICINE. He caught them doing it to me also. We also found at one point both of them on separate occasions had our names on some IDs. Josh has Chris Greens name but his picture. Chris Greens wife Melissa had a social security card with the last name Williamson on it. There is some oral grade anesthesia that is available and I think some of these people might be using TELEDOC to do this. But I have woken up on many occasions with a sore throat over the course of my life. And I have had some brown students tell me one time that only happens to WHITE PEOPLE. There are these videos and music about something called DRIP DRIP. I even have this girl over here wear a ""Drippin"" baret in front of me. I also want to know about all of these REPLICA raves and political parties that people are having. Also the replica MS 150 race that large numbers of people are participating in and some of them even moved to where I am located thousands of miles away! 

But Chris Green and I have caught them several times seeing each other and I think they pretended to mess around so they could talk about he and I. I also want to know about the replica trips you all take and I want to know if you all bringing a look alike in so if and when we run into one another (Chris and I) I will talk about the trip. But a long time ago I was approached and I know lots of others where also of obtaining a ""Top Secret Security Clearance"" at Houston ISD. So I also want to know if these things have occurred sue to this phenomenon. I want to know why all of these people are using this OPT OUT SCRIBBLE signature and everyone leeching off of us. I believe even if you used to install cable and walk through over the phone in which I have done before for cable companies you could be multimillionaire. Because people are using our entertainment and streaming onto other planets/worlds. But I want to know if some of these gaps of employment are due to a bunch of BS or you all put me to sleep so I don't leave with someone like Chris Green.",0,2025-03-04T20:26:49Z

Whilst I'm not sure how the place operated back in '89, you definitely can't order ""what she's having"" from where they are sat these days, because the waited-on area is a small section round the back to the right where the toilets are. The main dining area shown in this scene is for people who queue up at the cutters only. Therefore that line is a movie blooper, and could potentially also be a blooper in 1989 if their table service policy was the same.

When I lived in Ghana, Kendrick Lamar came to Ghana in 2022, Usher performed in Ghana in 2022, SZA performed in Ghana in 2022, after Sunday all 3 of them would have performed at the Super Bowl.

The NFL Africa launched in Ghana in 2022. The Super Bowl in 2023 was the 1st in Super Bowl history to have 2 black Quarterbacks face off Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes 2 years later return to have another historic face off.

Inside my documentary I discuss Trump Tower being adjacent to Tiffany & Co jewelers. Tiffany’s creates the trophy’s for the NFL, NBA, MLS etc. My middle name is Tiffany! Now after putting this in my documentary, Trump became the 1st President attending a super bowl game.

The link to my documentary is on my YouTube channel to watch it.",0,2025-02-11T03:28:31Z
