1i29l80,m7dbr1a,kingoftheplastics,"I’m an insurance adjuster for property/homeowners and I work for State Farm. Standard corporate disclosure that everything that follows is my own opinions/thoughts/perspectives and I don’t speak for the company. That said, I think it might be useful to shed a bit of light on what actually happens behind the scenes in natural disaster claims and how it impacts your rates and what insurance companies choose to do as a business decision.

The first thing to understand is that your insurance company, has an insurance company. It’s very-creatively called “reinsurance” and it helps insurers eat the multibillion dollar costs associated with wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes and the like, and remain solvent. The two biggest reinsurers that I know of are Chubb and Lloyds of London, btw, and they reinsure dozens of first-line insurance companies as well as selling specialty products themselves (think insuring cruise ships and oil tankers and such). 

With that said, let’s talk about what happens when claims are filed and paid. The insurer incurs a financial loss, because it has to pay claims in accordance with its policies, and then has to recoup that loss somehow. It does this in two major ways: by raising premiums (either in the specific state, or across the board), and through its reinsurer. At the reinsurance level a similar scenario plays out, the financial burden associated with the risk absorbed is distributed across its clients and trickles down. This is why you might see your rates go up after a bad hurricane year, even if you personally didn’t file a claim or even live in a hurricane impacted state. The financial burden of the risk is distributed across the network of insured parties in exchange for a promise that if and when your number comes up, you’ll be covered.

So what’s different about California? California has passed various laws restricting the rate at which premium increases can occur, capping premiums altogether in some instances, and impacting the way insurance companies are allowed to settle claims. For example: in most states, if you file a claim for hail damage to your roof (probably the most common one I see), you get paid on what is called “recoverable depreciation” meaning you have an up-front payment called an “actual cash value” and then additional funds available if the work is completed within a certain timeframe. Example: I have a 15 year old roof, my claim for damages comes up to $15k. The insurance company pays me $10k up front, the other $5k depreciated based on the age of the roof, to be payable to me as long as I have the work done within 2 years. In California, there is no hold-back. If your claim is worth $15k, or $150k, or $1.5m, that’s what you get, all up-front. This puts significant strain on the companies’ reserve funds particularly if there’s a large volume of claims coming in (such as in a natural disaster) and so the company is inclined to offset these losses with rate increases. But it can’t, because of the rate-cap laws. All this adds up to an unprofitable business proposition that companies are increasingly less willing to tolerate, hence the moves to exit the California market.

I neither condone nor condemn, that’s just how it works.",192,2025-01-15 19:35:20,/r/nfl/comments/1i29l80/state_farm_pulls_out_of_super_bowl_ad_amid_fire/m7dbr1a/

1i29l80,m7cq4oq,WallyLohForever,"It is difficult for insurance companies to operate when disasters become regular occurances instead of rare events. If you couple that with California capping the rate increases insurance companies can charge, it becomes infeasible for much of California to be insured against fire. If the yearly cost of fire is higher than what insurance companies are allowed to charge, it is no wonder that insurance companies leave. If you want insurance companies to offer reinsurance, you need to let them charge more or reduce the severity of natural disasters. Capping costs and pointing fingers at insurance companies when they leave is easy so it is hardly surprsing that it is the decision that gets made.


The same thing is happening in the hurricane prone southeast and the floodplains across the country. Laws prevent insurance companies from charging enough to cover damages so insurance companies leave and the government ends up footing the bill. This keeps it artificially cheap to live in areas ravaged by natural disasters.",841,2025-01-15 17:37:07,/r/nfl/comments/1i29l80/state_farm_pulls_out_of_super_bowl_ad_amid_fire/m7cq4oq/

I remember this bc my dad and stepmom recorded that commercial and made my sister and I investigate the commercial, Zapruder film level, to look for all the logos. I didn’t want to bc I wanted to watch the game. But, I was 10, and this was 1999, so no way to stream it or get updates on the game. And there was only one tv. So, I had to help against my will to help in hopes we could solve it and watch the rest of the game.

1imysjy,mc6m3q8,funnysasquatch,"Super Bowl ads should be ignored by marketers because Super Bowl ads are rarely intended to ever market anything. 

TV ads, more than any other form of marketing, is what gives marketing a bad reputation. And the Super Bowl  ads are the worst of the bunch.

Marketing should do one of 2 things:

1 - Result in the direct sale of a product - not as simple to do with TV - though QR codes and smart TVs make this easier now  

2 - Increase brand awareness of a product - this is what TV tends to do best 

But since most executives making decisions about TV ads don't understand marketing, they focus on the non-marketing parts of TV ads. 

They approve ads that are entertaining or look cool or have a chance to win awards and not marketing achievenments. 

This is why Super Bowl ads rarely result in more sales of anything.

I'm a marketing guy. While I do have experience with direct response - most of my marketing is general PR. 

Doesn't change the fact that most Super Bowl ads are not produced in a way to market anything.",-2,2025-02-11 09:53:41,/r/marketing/comments/1imysjy/which_super_bowl_ads_did_you_like_the_most_this/mc6vflu/

1imysjy,mc72l08,CriticalSea540,"As a guy who has worked on 3 SB campaigns, I would disagree with your criticism. If you’re selling b2b software or are a start up needing immediate sales then sure, Super Bowl isn’t right. But for the cokes, Nikes, etc of the world—there’s no better marketing opp than the SB. Nothing comes close to the reach you get (120M at once) with attention (!). Coke doesn’t need DR sales. They need to be the first soda you think of and love when you’re checking out at the grocery store. Of course, you can still have a bad / ineffective SB ad if it’s not memorable or the brand connection isn’t remembered, but overall the studies I’ve seen show massive ROI for SB ads on the whole (EDIT: $4.60 ROI according to Kantar). 

And I’d argue that digital banner ads are 10000% the reason marketing gets a bad rap. Not entertaining SB ads, which people look forward to every year.

1imysjy,mc74bdz,brooklyneeeeer,"I agree here too. For me, this is reasonable that some brands spend that crazy money for brand awareness or to declare some social statement. also believe those brands get a lot of new users/buyers; it depends on the actual ad and their goals.",2,2025-02-11 10:38:29,/r/marketing/comments/1imysjy/which_super_bowl_ads_did_you_like_the_most_this/mc74bdz/
1imysjy,mc7jhmj,funnysasquatch,"I never said Super Bowl ads are Direct Response. 

I also didn't say the SB wasn't a good chance to market your brand. 

I said that most companies waste the opportunity because the focus isn't on brand-building. It's on either being entertaining or winning awards. 

I'm glad your ads worked out - but it's the exception, not the norm.",1,2025-02-11 11:50:33,/r/marketing/comments/1imysjy/which_super_bowl_ads_did_you_like_the_most_this/mc7jhmj/

1imdh3h,mc29zwn,None,"Good super bowl ads do 6 things, summarized by the acronym ADPLAN:

Attention - the ad grabs the viewers attention. This is where the humor, celebrities, etc come in.

Distinction - the ad is unique in its delivery so it doesn't get lost in the noise. Pringles and Little Caesars failed at this with their dueling flying facial hair ads

Positioning - the ad brings to life the product's positioning in the market and key benefits. I thought the Michelob Ultra commercial with Willem Defoe and Kathryn O'Hara hustling people at pickleball for Michelob Ultras did this well because they position themselves as the beer for people who live active lifestyles because it's lower cal.

Linkage - can the viewer recall what brand/product was advertised? When people say ""I saw this really funny ad where XYZ happened. I don't remember what it was an ad for,"" the brand has failed at linkage. The key to creating linkage is to introduce the brand/product early and often. The Glenn Powell RAM ad is a good example. Making a cinematic Americana masterpiece and only flashing the logo in the last two seconds is a common way companies fail at this, for example the Rocket mortgage ad.

Amplification - generating more attention/viralty through pre and post super bowl tactics so the $8M+ investment doesn't just get 30 seconds of people's attention 

Net Equity - Especially for brands with a legacy, the ad should connect to long-standing brand attributes. This is why Budweiser uses the Clydesdales every year and why the Jaguar rebrand was widely panned as an epic failure.",5,2025-02-10 14:09:55,/r/marketing/comments/1imdh3h/humor_in_superbowl_commercials/mc29zwn/
1imdh3h,mc45vm4,Warm-Tumbleweed6057,"The Pringles ad worked for me because the mustache is part of their logo.

1imdh3h,mc7rjdh,drbeau2019,"Great list!! Depending on how humor is used, it can help with some of the dimensions on your list. For example, the Instacart ad used humor to better illustrate how great their service is. But humor used in some other ads like the Nerdwallet ad seem forced and didn’t do much to the brand other than garnering attention for only a subset of audience.",1,2025-02-11 12:28:26,/r/marketing/comments/1imdh3h/humor_in_superbowl_commercials/mc7rjdh/
1imdh3h,mc7t1yd,drbeau2019,"It seems like the ad’s goal was to convey that the product is so tasty it makes an unforgettable impact. To visualize this “impact,” they chose to highlight Eugene’s signature eyebrows, which are distinctive and eye-catching. This approach is used quite a bit in other ads, where exaggerated changes are used to represent a dramatic effect or impact that their products can make. But how well these work is another story, because some seem forced as you alluded to.",2,2025-02-11 12:35:33,/r/marketing/comments/1imdh3h/humor_in_superbowl_commercials/mc7t1yd/

1io0pqg,mcflrll,YeomanTax,"There are many reasons to run a Super Bowl ad. It's not always about pure ""awareness"" but also about putting pressure on Retailers to carry the product. As much as Marketing likes to take the credit, it's often pure Distribution that is a main driver of sales.

Companies will often use advertising on the Super Bowl as a negotiation tactic. Acceptance of the product, promotional priority, placement, competitor blocking, and even Retail Media discounts often hinge on the brand's decision to run on the Super Bowl. 

For a few years now Nike had shifted to a DTC strategy, where Awareness was less of a focus and ecommerce/Performance was the priority... and they've been losing marketshare as a result. They needed to change their strategy and admit they were wrong. So being on the Super Bowl for them was more than just yelling from the mountaintops, but rather showing Retailers that they're serious about getting back into Brand Building which ultimately will drive shoppers to stores.

Keep in mind: what's reported in the media is not the whole picture. The Super Bowl is MUCH MORE expensive than we realize. Not only do you buy the spot itself (and the rate changes based on WHEN your ad is run during the game), but there's also a match commitment typically required by the network. That means the brand needs to spend an equal amount on the network's other properties throughout the year. Not to mention the NFL fees if you want to use the NFL logo or 6+ players in the ad.

So take the pricetag of one :30s spot and double it. At least.

Would Nike see the same benefit if they discounted their products by $16 million? Doubtful. Even if they did, it wouldn't last long. And discounts don't get your new products accepted or any negotiation advantage. If anything, it makes Nike less desirable.

Finally. Let's be honest. Nike has a $100 million annual media budget, so it's barely a dent.",3,2025-02-12 15:57:48,/r/marketing/comments/1io0pqg/super_bowl_ads/mcflrll/
1io0pqg,mcfiw1c,Flinkaroo,"Speaking from a purely devils advocate perspective - I think it just can’t happen because of the financials behind it.

If the data shows that a 30 sec ad lead to an X% increase sales and lead to a positive ROAS and you were telling me not to do it I would say “well you don’t know what you’re talking about because the numbers do not lie”.

But say Nike et al, who definitely do not need the ad, do decide not to run it. Eventually the Stations would lower the price to come down. Then you would have a smaller company saying “holy crap this is our chance”.

It would just trickle down until someone accepts that X% increase in ROAS will offset the negative aspect of the protest rationale.

OR - They give away the time free to a charity and everyone wins, except us, discussing on Reddit 😅",2,2025-02-12 15:44:49,/r/marketing/comments/1io0pqg/super_bowl_ads/mcfiw1c/
