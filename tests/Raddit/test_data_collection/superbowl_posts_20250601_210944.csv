If Mahomes wins Super Bowl 59, Brady and Mahomes would account for 18.6% (11/59) of all Super Bowl wins.",AvengingHero2012,2025-01-27 12:35:19,85,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1ibeu9j/with_patrick_mahomes_reaching_the_super_bowl_14/,nfl,"Now, Patrick Mahomes has reached 5 Super Bowls and Tom Brady reached 10. Why is it 14/59 and not 15/59? It‚Äôs because there was the one overlap with Super Bowl 55 where the Tom Brady and the Bucs played Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.

What do percentages look like if we add in Joe Montana? Montana made 4 Super Bowls. Adding his 4 in, 30.5% of all Super Bowls (18/59) have involved a team quarterbacked by Brady, Mahomes, or Montana. Montana also won all four of his Super Bowl trips. If Mahomes wins Super Bowl 59, Brady, Montana, and Mahomes would account for a fourth of all Super Bowls wins [15/59; 25.4%].",/r/nfl/comments/1ibeu9j/with_patrick_mahomes_reaching_the_super_bowl_14/
1imn7bi,Hulu: I don‚Äôt see the actual Super Bowl ads.,jennilynn52,2025-02-10 20:39:44,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1imn7bi/hulu_i_dont_see_the_actual_super_bowl_ads/,advertising, I see what ads Hulu serves me. How do you watch Super Bowl to see the actual ads. Like Nike was going to have an ad for the first time in 27 years and the Yeezy ad and all of that. I just got several of the same ad I always get when watching Hulu. This I think is a platform ad serv thing. But where/how do you watch to see the actual SB advertisements?

1ksg1zy,Am I the only one who HATES Liberty Mutual ads üóΩ,pensivvv,2025-05-21 22:35:59,128,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1ksg1zy/am_i_the_only_one_who_hates_liberty_mutual_ads/,advertising,"Genuine question: is their marketing strategy to rage bait audiences with stupid ads so they talk about the brand? If so, it‚Äôs working. 

Specifically I‚Äôm talking about the one where the man who‚Äôs clearly dubbed is arguing with a 2-year old about ‚Äúbibberty‚Äù being the correct pronunciation for Liberty. 

Drives me insane. Insane. It‚Äôs so dumb. So so dumb. It  has made me a sworn enemy of the brand and I will never get their insurance haha
(Overreaction maybe‚Ä¶ but if you‚Äôve seen the ad‚Ä¶. 200x‚Ä¶. you may get it)

EDIT:
While I accept that this was probably purposefully annoying, I also wanted to raise the question: at what point is too much annoying exposure bad for the brand? I think to consensus below that all exposure is good because insurance is boring and you just need a few known brands to pull quotes from is true to an extent, but surely a prolonged ad campaign with pure brain rot will damage the brand after a while.

Examples: 
- Quiznos screaming, shrieking creatures ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù adds. Notable at first? Yea. Annoying af. Now their brand is dead
- Go daddy tacky sexy Ads. Notable? Yep, but They‚Äôve been trying to rebuild that brand image since
- nationwide dead kid Super Bowl ad- shocking? Notable? Yea. Terrible for the brand? Haha yea.
- Jc penny - ‚Äúthe man is back‚Äù campaign. Notable? Oh yea it was weird. But it missed the target market. 
- Reebok: cheat on your girlfriend campaign. Lmao bad for obvious reasons. 
- Bud light - I mean‚Ä¶ pick a campaign. ‚ÄúUp for whatever‚Äù got flack for irresponsible drinking, sent them I to a spiral, then they go lgbtq friendly and deviate from typical ‚Äúredneck‚Äù market. That didn‚Äôt go well for the brand. 

All notable campaigns that negatively impacted the brand and sometimes the stock.

1ealdje,The CereVe campaign was way more that I realized,Pristine_Net_988,2024-07-23 18:40:08,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ealdje/the_cereve_campaign_was_way_more_that_i_realized/,marketing,"So obviously you're familiar with the CeraVe x Michael Cera Super Bowl ad right?

I had not a clue it was so well orchestrated leading up to the Bowl. Then they are still using part of the creative on paid ads rn.

I saw this thread that broke it down: [https://x.com/DanRagan/status/1815876802864107827](https://x.com/DanRagan/status/1815876802864107827) 

  
Any other brands that come to mind that can do this kind of play on words? Or would it be too much of a copy?
